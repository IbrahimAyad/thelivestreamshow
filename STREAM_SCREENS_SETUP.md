# Stream Screens Integration - Setup Complete! üé¨

## ‚úÖ What's Been Done

Your existing 4 HTML stream screens have been integrated into the broadcast system:

1. **Starting Soon** (`stream-starting-soon.html`) - Countdown timer with animated ball
2. **BRB** (`stream-brb-screen.html`) - Be Right Back screen
3. **Tech Issues** (`stream-technical-issues.html`) - Technical difficulties screen
4. **OUTRO** (`stream-outro-screen.html`) - End of show screen

Plus the existing **Logo** graphic.

All HTML files are now in `/public` folder and wired up to the Graphics Overlays panel.

## üìã Final Setup Step - Run Database Migration

**You need to run this SQL in your Supabase dashboard:**

### Step 1: Go to Supabase SQL Editor
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/vcniezwtltraqramjlux/sql

### Step 2: Click "+ New Query"

### Step 3: Copy and paste the contents of `add-html-file-to-graphics.sql`

Or manually paste this SQL:

```sql
-- Add html_file column to broadcast_graphics table
ALTER TABLE broadcast_graphics
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS html_file TEXT;

COMMENT ON COLUMN broadcast_graphics.html_file IS 'Path to HTML file for full-screen overlay graphics';

-- Update existing graphics to set html_file based on graphic_type
UPDATE broadcast_graphics
SET html_file = CASE
  WHEN graphic_type = 'starting_soon' THEN '/stream-starting-soon.html'
  WHEN graphic_type = 'brb' THEN '/stream-brb-screen.html'
  WHEN graphic_type = 'tech_difficulties' THEN '/stream-technical-issues.html'
  WHEN graphic_type = 'outro' THEN '/stream-outro-screen.html'
  WHEN graphic_type = 'logo' THEN NULL
  ELSE NULL
END
WHERE html_file IS NULL;
```

### Step 4: Click "Run" (or press Cmd+Enter)

## üé¨ How to Use

### In the Director Dashboard:

1. Go to the **Graphics Overlays** panel
2. You'll see 5 buttons ordered for stream flow:
   - **Starting Soon** - Click before show starts
   - **BRB** - Click when taking a break
   - **Tech Issues** - Click if you're having technical problems
   - **OUTRO** - Click to show end-of-show screen
   - **Logo** - Toggle your logo overlay

3. When you click a screen button:
   - It will display **full-screen** on the broadcast overlay
   - Viewers see the beautiful HTML screen
