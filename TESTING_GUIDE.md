## Database Verification Queries

If you want to verify data in Supabase:

```sql
-- View all templates
SELECT id, name, description, is_template
FROM shows
WHERE is_template = true;

-- View all sessions
SELECT id, episode_number, episode_title, status, duration_seconds, created_at
FROM show_sessions
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- View session with full details
SELECT *
FROM show_sessions
WHERE id = '[session-id]';

-- View segments for a show
SELECT show_id, name, topic, position
FROM show_segments
WHERE show_id = '[show-id]'
ORDER BY position;

-- View questions for a show
SELECT show_id, question_text, topic, position
FROM show_questions
WHERE show_id = '[show-id]'
ORDER BY position;
```

---

## Known Behaviors

1. **Template Loading**: Triggers full page reload after successful clone
2. **Session Creation**: Creates new record immediately on "Start Show"
3. **Session ID**: Passed to EndShowModal for archiving
4. **Export Format**: Pretty-printed JSON with 2-space indentation
5. **Delete Confirmation**: Required for template deletion

---

## Troubleshooting

### Template Not Loading

- Verify `clone_template_to_show` function exists in Supabase
- Check database permissions

### Session Not Creating
- Verify `show_sessions` table exists
- Check show_metadata has episode info populated
- Review console logs for session creation errors

### Export Not Downloading
- Check browser download settings
- Verify session data is complete
- Look for JSON serialization errors

### AI Generation Failing
- Verify VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY is set
- Check OpenAI API quota/billing
- Review network tab for API errors
