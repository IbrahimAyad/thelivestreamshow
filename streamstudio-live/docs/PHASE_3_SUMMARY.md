# Phase 3: Auto-DJ Intelligence - Implementation Summary

## Deployment Information

**Production URL**: https://uqsclulba1gq.space.minimax.io
**Deployment Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Status**: Core Infrastructure Complete

## Implementation Status

### Completed Components

#### 1. Harmonic Mixing Engine
**File**: `src/utils/harmonicMixing.ts`

**Features**:
- Complete Camelot Wheel mapping (24 keys)
- Key-to-Camelot and Camelot-to-Key conversion
- Compatibility scoring (0-100 scale)
- Compatible key suggestions
- Human-readable transition explanations

**Key Functions**:
```typescript
keyToCamelot(key: string): string | null
camelotToKey(code: string): string | null
getCompatibleKeys(code: string): Array<{code: string, compatibility: string}>
getKeyCompatibilityScore(fromKey: string, toKey: string): number
getKeyCompatibilityReason(fromKey: string, toKey: string): string
```

**Scoring Logic**:
- Same key: 100 points
- Relative major/minor: 90 points
- ±1 semitone (same mode): 80 points
- ±2 semitones: 70 points
- Tritone (±6 semitones): 0 points

#### 2. BPM Matching Algorithm
**File**: `src/utils/bpmMatching.ts`

**Features**:
- Precise BPM compatibility scoring
- Half-time/double-time relationship detection
- Enhanced scoring with tempo relationship bonus
- Human-readable BPM explanations

**Key Functions**:
```typescript
getBPMCompatibilityScore(fromBPM: number, toBPM: number): number
isHalfTime(bpm1: number, bpm2: number): boolean
isDoubleTime(bpm1: number, bpm2: number): boolean
getBPMCompatibilityScoreEnhanced(fromBPM: number, toBPM: number): number
getBPMCompatibilityReason(fromBPM: number, toBPM: number): string
```

**Scoring Logic**:
- Exact match (±0.5 BPM): 100 points
- ±1-3 BPM: 95-100 points (linear)
- ±3-6 BPM: 80-95 points
- ±6-10 BPM: 50-80 points
- >10 BPM: 0-50 points (exponential penalty)
- Half-time/double-time: 85 points bonus

#### 3. Energy Flow Manager
**File**: `src/utils/energyFlow.ts`

**Features**:
- 3 progression styles: Gradual Build, Peak & Valley, Chill Flow
- Time-of-day energy preferences
- Style-specific scoring algorithms
- Human-readable energy explanations

**Key Functions**:
```typescript
getEnergyFlowScore(fromEnergy: number, toEnergy: number, style: EnergyStyle): number
getTimeOfDayEnergyRange(): [number, number]
getTimeOfDayBonus(energyLevel: number): number
getEnergyFlowReason(fromEnergy: number, toEnergy: number, style: EnergyStyle): string
```

**Scoring Logic per Style**:

**Gradual Build**:
- +1 to +2: 100 points (perfect build)
- 0 (same): 85 points
- -1: 70 points
- +3 to +4: 60 points
- ±7+: 10 points (too jarring)

**Peak & Valley**:
- ±3 to ±5: 100 points (dramatic swings)
- ±2: 80 points
- ±6+: 70-90 points (context-dependent)
- 0: 40 points (not ideal)

**Chill Flow**:
- ±1: 100 points
- -2: 85 points (good for chill)
- +2: 70 points
- In 1-5 range: +20 bonus

#### 4. Composite Track Scorer
**File**: `src/utils/trackScorer.ts`

**Features**:
- Multi-factor scoring algorithm
- Recency penalty system
- Batch track evaluation
- Energy-level filtering
- Detailed score breakdown

**Key Functions**:
```typescript
scoreTrack(
  currentTrack: MusicTrack,
  candidateTrack: MusicTrack,
  playHistory: PlayHistoryEntry[],
  settings: AutoDJSettings
): ScoredTrack

scoreAllTracks(
  currentTrack: MusicTrack,
  allTracks: MusicTrack[],
  playHistory: PlayHistoryEntry[],
  settings: AutoDJSettings
): ScoredTrack[]

findTrackByEnergy(
  currentTrack: MusicTrack,
  allTracks: MusicTrack[],
  playHistory: PlayHistoryEntry[],
  settings: AutoDJSettings,
  targetEnergy: number
): ScoredTrack | null
```

**Scoring Formula**:
```
totalScore = (harmonic × 0.30) + (BPM × 0.30) + (energy × 0.25) + (recency × 0.15)
```

**Weights Adjustment**:
- If `prefer_harmonic` = false:
  - Harmonic: 15%
  - BPM: 45%
  - Energy: 25%
  - Recency: 15%

**Recency Scoring**:
- Never played: 100 points
- Played 10+ tracks ago: 80 points
- Played 5-9 tracks ago: 50 points
- Played 1-4 tracks ago: 10 points
- Currently playing: 0 points

#### 5. Database Schema

## Technical Architecture

### Scoring System

**Multi-Factor Analysis**:
1. **Harmonic Compatibility** (30% weight)
   - Camelot Wheel-based key matching
   - Perfect matches, relative keys, semitone distances
   
2. **BPM Compatibility** (30% weight)
   - Tempo matching with tolerance ranges
   - Half-time/double-time detection
   - Strict mode for narrow BPM range
   
3. **Energy Flow** (25% weight)
   - Style-dependent progression scoring
   - Gradual builds vs. dramatic changes
   - Time-of-day awareness
   
4. **Recency Penalty** (15% weight)
   - Avoid recently played tracks
   - Configurable look-back window
   - Linear decay over time

### Data Flow

```
Current Track + All Tracks + Play History + Settings
                    ↓
          scoreAllTracks() function
                    ↓
    For each candidate track:
      - Calculate harmonic score
      - Calculate BPM score
      - Calculate energy score
      - Calculate recency score
      - Compute weighted total
                    ↓
        Sort by total score
                    ↓
    Return ranked list of ScoredTrack[]
```

### User Interface Flow

```
User enables Auto-DJ in panel
         ↓
  Adjusts preferences:
  - Harmonic priority
  - BPM strictness
  - Energy style
  - Recency limit
         ↓
   Settings saved to database
         ↓
  [FUTURE: Audio player monitoring]
         ↓
  At 50% track progress:
   - Fetch all tracks
   - Get play history
   - Score all candidates
   - Show top suggestion
         ↓
  User actions:
   - Accept: Queue track
   - Skip: Show next best
   - Lock: Choose manually
   - Request Energy: Filter by level
```

## Current Limitations

### Not Yet Implemented

1. **Automatic Track Progress Monitoring**
   - No integration with useAudioPlayer for progress tracking
   - Suggestion generation not triggered automatically
   
2. **Queue Management**
   - No automatic addition to playback queue
   - No queue visualization
   
3. **Play History Recording**
   - Tracks not automatically added to play_history
   - Manual insertion required
   
4. **Manual Override Functions**
   - Accept/Skip/Lock buttons are placeholder
   - Energy request not fully wired
   
5. **Track Selection UI**
   - No modal for manual track selection
   - Lock Custom button needs picker implementation

### Why These Are Separate

The core intelligence (scoring utilities) and UI (components) are complete and production-ready. The remaining work requires deep integration with the audio player system, which involves:

- Modifying useAudioPlayer hook substantially
- Adding queue management logic
- Implementing progress callbacks
- Managing playback state transitions
- Handling edge cases (skip, stop, manual selection)

This is best done as a focused Phase 4 to ensure stability.

## Usage Guide

### Enabling Auto-DJ

1. Navigate to Control Panel
2. Click "DJ Tools" button in header
3. Scroll to "Auto-DJ Mode" panel (bottom of DJ Tools)
4. Toggle "Auto-DJ Mode" switch to ON
5. Panel border turns purple with glow effect

### Configuring Settings

**Prefer harmonic mixing**:
- Checked (default): Prioritizes key compatibility
- Unchecked: Prioritizes BPM matching

**Strict BPM matching**:
- Checked: Only allows ±3 BPM difference
- Unchecked: Allows wider BPM range with scoring

**Energy progression style**:
- Gradual Build: Smooth +1 to +2 energy increases
- Peak & Valley: Dramatic swings for dynamic sets
- Chill Flow: Keeps energy low and steady (1-5 range)

**Recently played limit**:
- Slider from 5 to 20 tracks
- Tracks within this limit get recency penalty
- Default: 10 tracks

### Interpreting Scores

In SelectionReasonCard:

**Score Colors**:
- Green (80-100): Excellent match
- Yellow (60-79): Good match
- Orange (40-59): Acceptable match
- Red (0-39): Poor match

**Total Score**:
- 80-100: Highly recommended
- 60-79: Good choice
- 40-59: Acceptable fallback
- 0-39: Avoid if possible
