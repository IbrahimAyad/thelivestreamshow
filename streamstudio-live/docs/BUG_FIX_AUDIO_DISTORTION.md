# Critical Bug Fix - October 19, 2025

## Issue
All audio files were playing a loud distorted "horn sound" instead of their actual content, and sounds were not stopping properly.

## Root Cause
The reverb ConvolverNode was always active in the audio signal path, even when effects were set to their default values (all zeros). The ConvolverNode applies its impulse response to ALL audio passing through it, which caused severe distortion when no effects were intended.

## Technical Details

### Original (Broken) Implementation:
```
Source -> GainNode -> DuckingGainNode -> EffectsChain -> AnalyserNode -> Destination
                                           |
                                           +-> Reverb (ALWAYS ACTIVE)
                                           +-> Delay
                                           +-> Filters
                                           +-> Distortion
                                           +-> Compression
```

Problem: Audio ALWAYS went through reverb, delay, etc., even at zero settings.

### Fixed Implementation:
```
Source -> GainNode -> DuckingGainNode -> InputNode -+-> BypassNode (Gain: 1.0 when no effects) -+-> OutputNode -> AnalyserNode -> Destination
                                                     |
                                                     +-> WetNode (Gain: 0.0 when no effects) -> [Effects Chain] -+
```

## Solution

Implemented a **bypass/wet routing system** in `AudioEffectsChain`:

1. **Dual Signal Paths**:
   - **Bypass Path**: Direct route (dry signal) when no effects active
   - **Wet Path**: Through effects chain when effects are enabled

2. **Smart Routing**:
   - `hasActiveEffects()` checks if any effect is non-zero
   - `updateRouting()` switches between bypass and wet based on effect state
   - Gain nodes control which path is active (1.0 = on, 0.0 = off)

3. **State Management**:
   - Default state: bypass ON (gain: 1.0), wet OFF (gain: 0.0)
   - Effects active: bypass OFF (gain: 0.0), wet ON (gain: 1.0)
   - Seamless switching without audio pops

## Code Changes

### src/utils/audioEffects.ts

**Added Nodes**:
```typescript
private inputNode: GainNode
private bypassNode: GainNode
private wetNode: GainNode
private isBypassed: boolean = true
```

**New Methods**:
```typescript
private buildEffectsChain(): void
private hasActiveEffects(effects: AudioEffectsConfig): boolean
private updateRouting(): void
```

**Modified Connection**:
```typescript
connect(sourceNode: AudioNode, destinationNode: AudioNode): void {
  sourceNode.connect(this.inputNode)
  this.inputNode.connect(this.bypassNode)
  this.inputNode.connect(this.wetNode)
  this.bypassNode.connect(this.outputNode)
  this.outputNode.connect(destinationNode)
}
```

## Additional Fixes

1. **Delay Bounds**: Added `Math.max(0, Math.min(1, effects.delay))` to prevent invalid delay times
2. **Initial Feedback**: Set delay feedback to 0 on initialization
3. **Cleanup**: Added disconnect() for all new nodes

## Testing

### Expected Behavior:
- Default playback: Clean audio, no distortion
- DJ Tools disabled: Audio bypasses all effects
- Apply effects: Smooth transition to wet path
- Reset effects: Smooth transition back to bypass

### Test Cases:
1. Play track without DJ Tools: Should sound normal
2. Enable DJ Tools, keep effects at zero: Should still sound normal
3. Apply reverb preset: Should hear reverb effect
4. Reset to default: Should return to clean sound immediately

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal overhead**: Two additional gain nodes
- **Better performance at default**: Bypasses entire effects chain
- **No audio pops**: Smooth gain transitions
- **CPU savings**: Effects only processed when active

## Deployment

- **Fixed Version URL**: https://hes4mx9p837w.space.minimax.io
- **Deployment Date**: October 19, 2025, 13:58 UTC
- **Build Time**: 8.10s
- **Bundle Size**: 706.97 KB (154.86 KB gzipped)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always implement bypass**: Audio effects chains should have dry/wet routing
2. **Test default state**: Verify that "no effects" actually means no processing
3. **ConvolverNode caveat**: Always processes audio, requires bypass for true "off"
4. **Gain node switching**: Effective for seamless routing changes
