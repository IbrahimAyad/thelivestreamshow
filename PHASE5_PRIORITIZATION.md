# Phase 5: Feature Prioritization Matrix

## Executive Summary

This document helps prioritize Phase 5 features based on **impact**, **effort**, **risk**, and **dependencies**.

**Recommendation**: Start with **Predictive Scoring** ‚Üí **Cross-Show Learning** ‚Üí **Multi-Host** ‚Üí **Show Planning** ‚Üí **Dashboard**

---

## Scoring Methodology

Each feature is scored on:

### Impact (1-10)
- User value
- Business value
- Differentiation
- Network effects

### Effort (1-10)
- Development time
- Technical complexity
- Testing requirements
- Integration work

### Risk (1-10)

### Priority Score
```
Priority = (Impact √ó 2) - Effort - (Risk √ó 0.5)

Higher score = Higher priority
```
