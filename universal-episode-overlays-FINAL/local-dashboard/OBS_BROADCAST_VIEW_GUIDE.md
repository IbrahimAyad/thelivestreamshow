# OBS Broadcast View Setup Guide

The **Broadcast View** is a clean, professional display interface designed specifically for use as an OBS Browser Source. It eliminates all production controls and shows only viewer-facing content that updates in real-time as you make changes in the producer dashboard.

- **Countdown/Countup Timers** - Large, color-coded timers visible to your audience
- **Current Segment Info** - Displays the active rundown segment details
- **Real-time Sync** - All changes from the producer dashboard appear instantly

**No backend controls, no clutter‚Äîjust clean, professional broadcast content.**

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

1. **Keep Browser Source Active**
   - Don't use "Shutdown source when not visible"
   - Ensures real-time updates continue even when not on screen

2. **Use Separate Scenes for Different Layouts**
   - Scene 1: Full Broadcast View
   - Scene 2: Lower Third Only
   - Scene 3: Timer Overlay
   - Switch between scenes as needed

3. **Test Before Going Live**
   - Add a test video in producer dashboard
   - Verify it appears in Broadcast View
   - Test lower thirds and timers
   - Check animations and transitions

4. **Monitor Performance**
   - Browser sources can be CPU-intensive
   - If you experience lag, reduce FPS to 15-20
   - Or crop to show only needed elements

5. **Backup Plan**
   - Have static fallback graphics ready
   - If Broadcast View fails, switch to static scenes
   - Always have a "Technical Difficulties" scene
