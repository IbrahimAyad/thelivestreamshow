## Overview

This guide helps existing users upgrade from the basic Live Stream Production Dashboard to the new Professional Suite with 6 major enhancements.

## What's New

The Professional Suite adds:

1. üî¥ **Recording & Streaming Controls** - Start/stop with health monitoring
2. üé¨ **Scene Source Management** - Control individual sources
3. üéµ **Audio Presets System** - Save and apply audio configurations
4. üì∫ **Lower Thirds & Graphics** - Professional text overlays
5. üë• **User Roles & Permissions** - Multi-user with Producer/Host/Guest roles
6. üé® **Professional Scene Templates** - Pre-built OBS scene collections

## Breaking Changes

### Authentication System

**Previous Version:**
- No authentication
- Everyone had full access

**New Version:**
- Optional authentication (can still use without login)
- Three user roles with different permissions
- Guest users have limited access

**Impact:**
- If you DON'T log in: Works like before but no access to advanced features
- If you log in: Default role is "Guest" - need Producer to upgrade you

### Database Changes

**New Tables Created:**
- `audio_presets` - Audio preset configurations
- `lower_thirds` - Lower third graphics
- `user_profiles` - User accounts and roles

**Impact:**
- Existing data (YouTube queue, rundown, notes) is preserved
- No migration needed for existing data

### UI Layout Changes

**Previous Version:**
- 2 tabs: Production, Notes & Rundown

**New Version:**
- 3 tabs: Production, Advanced (Producers only), Notes & Rundown
- Authentication UI in header
- Team status panel added

**Impact:**
- Existing features moved to Production tab
- New features in Advanced tab
- Layout optimized for wider screens (XL breakpoint)

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Update the Application

**For Local Development:**

1. **Pull latest code** (if using git)
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Install new dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd local-dashboard
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Update .env file**
   - Add YouTube API key if not present
   - Verify Supabase credentials

4. **Rebuild**
   ```bash
   pnpm run build
   ```

**For Deployed Version:**
- The deployed version at https://ggi5h4n1l6el.space.minimax.io is already updated
- Note: OBS WebSocket won't work on public URL (use local development)

### Step 2: Database Setup

The new tables are automatically created via Supabase. Verify they exist:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Table Editor**
3. Confirm these tables exist:
   - `audio_presets`
   - `lower_thirds`
   - `user_profiles`

If any are missing, they'll be created on first use.

### Step 3: Enable Supabase Authentication (Optional)

If you want to use user roles:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí Authentication
2. **Enable Email Provider**:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Providers
   - Toggle "Email" provider ON
   - Configure email templates (optional)
3. **Configure Email Settings**:
   - Use Supabase's built-in SMTP (recommended for testing)
   - Or configure custom SMTP for production
4. **Enable Email Confirmations** (optional):
   - Settings ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Email Auth
   - Toggle "Enable email confirmations"

**Note:** If you don't enable auth, you can still use the dashboard - just without user roles.

### Step 4: Set Up OBS for Lower Thirds (Optional)

If you want to use the Lower Thirds feature:

1. **Open OBS Studio**
2. **Add two text sources** to your main scene:
   - Source 1: Name it exactly `LowerThird_Title`
   - Source 2: Name it exactly `LowerThird_Subtitle`
3. **Style the text sources**:
   - Font: Arial Bold (Title), Arial Regular (Subtitle)
   - Size: 36-48pt (Title), 24-28pt (Subtitle)
   - Color: White with black outline
   - Position: Bottom-left area (70px from left, 930px from top)
4. **Hide by default** (click eye icon)
5. The dashboard will control their visibility and text

### Step 5: Create Your First User Account

1. **Open the dashboard**
2. **Click "Sign Up"** (top right)
3. **Enter credentials**:
   - Display name (optional)
   - Email address
   - Password (minimum 6 characters)
4. **Verify email** (check inbox)
5. **Default role is Guest** - see below to upgrade

### Step 6: Upgrade Your First User to Producer

Since the first user will be a Guest, you need to manually upgrade them:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
2. **Navigate to:** Table Editor ‚Üí `user_profiles`
3. **Find your user** by email
4. **Edit the row**:
   - Change `role` from `guest` to `producer`
   - Click Save
5. **Log out and log back in** to the dashboard
6. You now have full Producer access!

### Step 7: Import OBS Scene Templates (Optional)

Try one of the professional scene templates:

1. **Choose a template** from `/obs-templates/`:
   - `talk_show_template.json`
   - `reaction_show_template.json`
   - `interview_template.json`
   - `panel_discussion_template.json`

2. **Import into OBS**:
   - OBS ‚Üí Scene Collection menu ‚Üí Import
   - Browse to the JSON file
   - Click Open

3. **Customize**:
   - Replace placeholder cameras with your actual devices
   - Adjust positioning and styling
   - See `OBS_TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md` for details

4. **Connect dashboard** to the new scene collection

2. Add them to your scene
3. Ensure they're not locked in OBS
4. Reconnect dashboard to OBS

### Issue: "Audio Presets not applying"

**Cause:** Source names in preset don't match OBS sources

**Solution:**
1. Check your OBS source names
2. Create new presets with current sources

### Issue: "Team Status not showing"

**Cause:** Not logged in

**Solution:**
1. Create an account
2. Log in
