# Camera Setup Guide

## üìπ WebRTC Browser Camera Integration

Your broadcast system uses WebRTC to access webcams directly in the browser. This means you can use any camera connected to your computer without additional software!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details

### Browser Permissions

**First-time setup:**
- Browser requests camera/microphone access
- You must click "Allow" for each domain
- Permission is saved for future visits

**If permission denied:**
1. Click the lock icon in browser address bar
2. Find "Camera" permissions
3. Change to "Allow"
4. Refresh page

### Supported Browsers

**Recommended:**
- ‚úÖ Google Chrome (best performance)
- ‚úÖ Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based)
- ‚úÖ Brave Browser

**Supported:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Firefox (works, but may have WebRTC issues)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Safari (works on macOS/iOS, limited features)

**Not Supported:**
- ‚ùå Internet Explorer

### Device Enumeration

**How detection works:**
1. You grant camera permission
2. Browser calls `navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices()`
3. All video input devices are listed
4. You select which device for each position

**Device ID:**
- Each camera has a unique `deviceId`
- This ID is saved in database
- Camera is accessed using this ID

### Resolution & Quality

**Default settings:**
- Browser requests default camera resolution
- Usually 720p or 1080p depending on camera
- No manual resolution selection (uses camera default)

**To improve quality:**
- Use better camera hardware
- Ensure good lighting
- Position camera at appropriate distance
- Clean camera lens

## üí° Pro Tips

### Lighting

**Make a huge difference:**
- Face a window or light source
- Don't sit with bright window behind you (backlit)
- Use ring light or desk lamp
- Avoid overhead lighting (creates shadows)

**Recommended setup:**
- Key light: Main light source (45¬∞ angle)
- Fill light: Softens shadows (opposite side)
- Backlight: Separates you from background (optional)

### Camera Positioning

**Height:**
- Camera at eye level or slightly above
- Don't point camera up (unflattering angle)
- Don't point camera down (too much)

**Distance:**
- Arm's length away (about 2-3 feet)
- Not too close (distortion)
- Not too far (lose detail)

**Framing:**
- Head room: Small space above head
- Look room: Space in direction you're looking
- Center yourself in frame

### Audio Quality

**Cameras have mics, but:**
- Built-in camera mics are usually poor
- Consider separate microphone
- USB mic (Blue Yeti, Audio-Technica)
- XLR setup for professional quality

**In Producer Dashboard:**
- Audio controls can adjust each camera's mic volume
- Use Audio Presets to save mic level configurations

### Background

**Keep it clean:**
- Declutter visible area
- No laundry, mess, or personal items
- Consider neutral wall or bookshelf
- Virtual backgrounds (if using virtual camera software)

### Multiple Cameras (Advanced)

**If using 4 cameras:**
- Ensure good lighting for all positions
- Balance audio levels across all mics
- Test each camera feed before going live
- Consider using USB hub for multiple USB cameras

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Problem: No cameras detected

**Solution:**
1. Click "Grant Permission" again
2. Check browser permissions (address bar lock icon)
3. Ensure camera is plugged in (USB cameras)
4. Try different USB port
5. Restart browser
6. Check if another app is using camera (close it)

### Problem: Camera shows "Camera not available"

**Solution:**
- Camera might be in use by another app
- Close Zoom, Skype, Teams, etc.
- Restart browser
- Unplug and replug USB camera
- Check camera drivers (Device Manager on Windows)

### Problem: Camera is laggy or freezes

**Solution:**
- Close other browser tabs
- Close other applications
- Use lower resolution camera
- Try different USB port (USB 3.0 if available)
- Update camera drivers
- Restart computer

### Problem: Audio but no video

**Solution:**
- Camera is toggled OFF (click eye icon to turn ON)

## üìä Performance Optimization

### Bandwidth Considerations

**Each camera stream uses bandwidth:**
- 1 camera (720p): ~1-2 Mbps
- 2 cameras: ~2-4 Mbps
- 4 cameras: ~4-8 Mbps

**If bandwidth limited:**
- Use fewer cameras
- Lower camera resolution
- Turn off cameras not currently in scene

### CPU Usage

**WebRTC uses CPU for:**
- Video encoding
- Audio processing
- Real-time rendering

**To reduce CPU load:**
- Close unnecessary browser tabs
- Close other applications
- Use hardware acceleration in browser
- Lower camera count

**Check CPU usage:**
- Windows: Task Manager
- macOS: Activity Monitor
- In-browser: Chrome Task Manager (Shift+Esc)

### Browser Performance

**For best performance:**
- Use Chrome or Edge
- Enable hardware acceleration (chrome://settings ‚Üí System)
- Close unused tabs
- Restart browser before long streams
- Clear browser cache periodically
