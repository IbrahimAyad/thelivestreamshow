# Browser-Based Broadcast Production System

## üé¨ Overview

Welcome to the **Complete Browser-Based Broadcast Production System**! This revolutionary approach allows you to create professional broadcast content entirely in your web browser. OBS becomes just a "capture window" - all graphics, scenes, camera positioning, and overlays are rendered in real-time HTML/CSS.

## üåü Key Concepts

### The Two-Dashboard System

**1. Producer Dashboard** (Your Control Center)
- URL: `https://your-dashboard-url.com/`
- Who sees it: Only you (the producer)
- What it does: Controls everything - scenes, cameras, graphics, timers, etc.
- Not shown on stream

**2. Broadcast View** (The Output)
- URL: `https://your-dashboard-url.com/broadcast`
- Who sees it: Your audience (via OBS Browser Source)
- What it does: Renders the actual broadcast output with all graphics and scenes
- This is what goes on stream

**How They Work Together:**
```
Producer Dashboard (Control)  ‚Üí  Supabase Database  ‚Üí  Broadcast View (Output)  ‚Üí  OBS  ‚Üí  Stream
     Your actions          Real-time sync      Renders instantly    Captures    Audience
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Tips

### Camera Best Practices

1. **Lighting**
   - Position yourself facing a window or light source
   - Avoid backlighting (don't sit in front of a bright window)
   - Use a ring light or desk lamp for best results

2. **Framing**
   - Center yourself in the frame
   - Leave some "head room" (space above your head)
   - Position camera at eye level or slightly above

3. **Mirror Settings**
   - Mirror your own camera so text/logos appear correctly to you
   - Don't mirror guest cameras unless they request it

### Graphics Design Tips

1. **Lower Thirds**
   - Keep text short and readable
   - Use high contrast (dark background, light text)
   - Don't show too many lower thirds at once
   - Auto-hide after 5-10 seconds

2. **LIVE Indicator**
   - Position in top-right for standard broadcast look
   - Use pulsing animation to draw attention
   - Only show when actually live

3. **Logo/Branding**
   - Keep it small (top-left or top-right corner)
   - Use 70-90% opacity to not distract
   - Ensure it contrasts with scene background

### Performance Optimization

1. **Browser Choice**
   - Use Chrome or Edge for best WebRTC performance
   - Close unnecessary browser tabs
   - Disable browser extensions that might interfere

2. **Camera Quality**
   - Lower resolution cameras = better performance
   - 720p is usually sufficient for streaming
   - 1080p if you have powerful hardware

3. **OBS Settings**
   - Set Browser Source FPS to 30 (not 60)
   - Use hardware encoding if available
   - Monitor CPU usage
