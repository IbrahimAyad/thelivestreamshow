# Simple OBS Setup Guide

## üéØ One Browser Source = Complete Broadcast

With the new browser-based broadcast system, OBS setup is incredibly simple. You only need **ONE Browser Source** to capture the entire broadcast output with all scenes, cameras, graphics, and overlays.

## üöÄ 3-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create a Scene in OBS

1. Open OBS Studio
2. In the "Scenes" panel (bottom-left), click the **"+"** button
3. Name it: **"Broadcast Output"** (or any name you prefer)
4. Click OK

**Result:** You now have an empty scene ready for your broadcast source

---

### Step 2: Add Browser Source

1. With your new scene selected, click the **"+"** button in the "Sources" panel
2. Select **"Browser"** from the list
3. Name it: **"Live Broadcast View"**
4. Click OK

**You'll now see the Browser Source Properties window.**

### Step 3: Configure Browser Source Settings

Fill in the following settings exactly:

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| **URL** | `https://your-dashboard-url.com/broadcast` | Your actual deployed Broadcast View URL |
| **Width** | `1920` | Full HD width (1080p) |
| **Height** | `1080` | Full HD height (1080p) |
| **FPS** | `30` | Smooth 30 frames per second |
| **CSS** | (leave empty) | No custom styling needed |
| **Shutdown source when not visible** | ‚ùå **UNCHECKED** | Keeps real-time sync active |
| **Refresh browser when scene becomes active** | ‚ùå **UNCHECKED** | Prevents interruptions |
| **Control audio via OBS** | ‚úÖ **CHECKED** | Lets OBS manage audio levels |

**Click "OK"** to save

**Result:** Your complete broadcast system is now rendering in OBS!

## ‚úÖ Verify Setup

### You should see:

1. The Browser Source fills your OBS canvas (1920x1080)
2. The current active scene from your Producer Dashboard
3. Any active cameras (if configured)
4. Any visible graphics overlays (LIVE indicator, logo, etc.)

### If you see a blank screen:

- Check that the URL is correct
- Ensure you have an active scene selected in Producer Dashboard
- Verify your internet connection (real-time sync requires it)
- Right-click the Browser Source ‚Üí "Refresh"

## üé¨ Production Workflow

### Before Going Live

**In Producer Dashboard:**
1. Select a scene (e.g., "Intermission")
2. Configure cameras (if needed)
3. Prepare lower thirds
4. Add YouTube videos to queue

**In OBS:**
1. Verify Browser Source is showing correctly
2. Check audio levels
3. Set up your streaming settings

### Going Live

**In Producer Dashboard:**
1. Switch to your opening scene
2. Toggle "LIVE Indicator" ON
3. Play intro video (if any)

**In OBS:**
1. Click "Start Streaming"
2. You're live!

### During Stream

**All control happens in Producer Dashboard:**
- Switch scenes with one click
- Show/hide lower thirds
- Play YouTube videos
- Start timers
- Toggle graphics on/off

**OBS automatically displays all changes in real-time.**

## üîß Advanced OBS Setup (Optional)

### Multiple Scenes for Different Layouts

If you want OBS-level scene switching (in addition to browser scene switching), you can create multiple OBS scenes:

**OBS Scene 1: "Full Broadcast"**
- Browser Source: Broadcast View (1920x1080)
- Use for: Complete browser-controlled output

**OBS Scene 2: "Lower Third Only"**
- Browser Source: Broadcast View (cropped to bottom 200px)
- Use for: Overlay lower third on other OBS sources

**OBS Scene 3: "Timer Only"**
- Browser Source: Broadcast View (cropped to timer area)
- Positioned in corner
- Use for: Timer overlay on other scenes

### Audio Configuration

**Recommended Setup:**

1. Right-click Browser Source ‚Üí "Advanced Audio Properties"
2. Set **Audio Monitoring** to "Monitor Off"
3. Leave **Audio Tracks** checked for Track 1

**Why:** This sends browser audio (YouTube videos, camera mics) to your stream without hearing it twice in your headphones.

**If you want to hear browser audio:**
- Set Audio Monitoring to "Monitor and Output"
- Use a different audio output device for monitoring

### Hardware Encoding

**To reduce CPU usage:**

1. OBS Settings ‚Üí Output
2. Change **Encoder** to:
   - **NVIDIA:** NVENC H.264
   - **AMD:** H264/AVC (AMD)
   - **Intel:** QuickSync H.264

**Result:** GPU handles encoding, CPU stays free for Browser Source rendering
