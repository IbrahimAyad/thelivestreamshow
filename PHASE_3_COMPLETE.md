# 🎉 Auto-Director Phase 3 - COMPLETE!

## ✅ What We Built

Phase 3 adds **Event-Based Triggers** - The system now automatically detects database events and triggers automation!

### New Core Service
- ✅ **EventListener** (`/src/lib/automation/EventListener.ts`)
  - Subscribes to Supabase Realtime events
  - Watches multiple tables simultaneously
  - Matches events against trigger_rules
  - Auto-reloads when rules change
  - Passes matched events to AutomationEngine for processing

### New UI Component
- ✅ **TriggerRulesPanel** (`/src/components/TriggerRulesPanel.tsx`)
  - Shows all trigger rules from database
  - Enable/disable rules with one click
  - Grouped by trigger type (Event, Keyword, Context, Timer)
  - Priority levels displayed with color coding
  - Real-time updates when rules change
  - Execution limits and approval requirements shown

### Integration Updates
- ✅ **useAutomationEngine** hook now creates and manages EventListener
- ✅ **AutomationEngine** accepts EventListener and processes events
- ✅ **App.tsx** includes TriggerRulesPanel in dashboard

## 🎮 How It Works

### The Automation Flow

```
1. Database Event Happens
   ↓
2. Supabase Realtime fires event
   ↓
3. EventListener receives event
   ↓
4. Checks against active trigger_rules
   ↓
5. Finds matching rule(s)
   ↓
6. Passes to AutomationEngine
   ↓
7. TriggerDetector analyzes event
   ↓
8. Creates AutomationDecision
   ↓
9. PriorityQueue orders it
   ↓
10. ActionExecutor executes it
    ↓
11. Event logged to automation_events
    ↓
12. Appears in AutomationFeedPanel
```

### Example: New Question Trigger

The database migration created this rule (disabled by default):

**Rule:** "Show indicator for new question"
- **Trigger Type:** Event
- **Event Source:** `show_questions` table
- **Event Type:** INSERT
- **Action:** `question.indicate` (show question indicator)
- **Priority:** 3 (Normal)
- **Mode:** Auto (if enabled)

**What Happens When You Enable It:**

1. You click "Disabled" → "Active" in TriggerRulesPanel
2. EventListener detects rule change and reloads
3. Subscribes to `show_questions` table
4. Now listening for INSERT events...

**When Someone Adds a Question:**

```sql
INSERT INTO show_questions (question_text, asked_by)
VALUES ('What is your favorite color?', 'Anonymous');
```

1. Supabase fires INSERT event
2. EventListener catches it
3. Matches against rule
4. Creates decision: "show question.indicate"
5. Auto-executes (100% confidence)
6. Question indicator appears on broadcast
7. Event logged with trigger_type = "event"
8. Appears in feed: "Event trigger → Question → Indicate → Executed"

**All automatic. No button clicking. Just works!**

---

## 🧪 How to Test Event-Based Automation

### Test 1: Question Indicator Trigger

**Setup:**
1. Run database migration if not done (`supabase-automation-schema.sql`)
2. Enable automation in AutomationConfigPanel
3. Go to TriggerRulesPanel
4. Find "Show indicator for new question" rule
5. Click "Disabled" → "Active"

**Test:**
1. Open Supabase Table Editor
2. Go to `show_questions` table
3. Click "Insert row"
4. Add question_text: "Test question"
5. Click "Save"

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Question indicator appears on broadcast view
- ✅ Event appears in AutomationFeedPanel:
  - Trigger type: "event"
  - Action: "Question → Indicate"
  - Outcome: "executed"
- ✅ Check `automation_events` table for the log entry

### Test 2: Custom Event Rule (Advanced)

Create your own rule! Here's SQL to add a new one:

```sql
INSERT INTO trigger_rules (
  rule_name,
  description,
  enabled,
  priority,
  trigger_type,
  trigger_conditions,
  action_type,
  action_params
) VALUES (
  'Auto-excited on new question',
  'Set BetaBot to excited when question added',
  true,
  3,
  'event',
  '{"event_source": "show_questions", "event_type": "insert"}'::jsonb,
  'betabot.mood',
  '{"mood": "excited", "intensity": 7}'::jsonb
);
```

Now when you insert a question, BetaBot will auto-excited!

## 📊 Trigger Rules Panel Features

### Rule Display
Each rule card shows:
- **Rule Name** and description
- **Trigger Icon** (⚡ Event, 💬 Keyword, 🧠 Context, 📅 Timer)
- **Priority Level** (P0-P5 with color coding)
- **Trigger Details** (what event/keyword/context triggers it)
- **Action Details** (what action will execute)
- **Execution Limit** (if rule has max executions per show)
- **Approval Requirement** (if operator must approve)
- **Enable/Disable Toggle** (Active ✅ / Disabled ⚠️)

### Priority Color Coding
- 🔴 **P0 Emergency** - Immediate critical actions
- 🟠 **P1 Critical** - High priority, safety-related
- 🟡 **P2 High** - Scheduled events, important triggers
- 🟢 **P3 Normal** - Regular automation (most rules)
- 🔵 **P4 Low** - Background enhancements
- ⚪ **P5 Background** - Logging, analytics

### Filters
- **All** - Show all rules
- **Enabled** - Show only active rules
- **Disabled** - Show only inactive rules

### Real-Time Updates
- Rules panel updates automatically when:
  - You enable/disable a rule
  - A rule is added/modified in database
  - Execution counts change

## 🔍 Example Rules from Database

The migration created 3 example rules:

### 1. Camera Switch on Keyword (Disabled)
```yaml
Rule: "Switch to Camera 2 on keyword"
Type: keyword
Keywords: ["camera 2", "switch to 2"]
Action: obs.scene → "Camera 2"
Priority: 2 (High)
Status: Disabled (OBS not configured yet)
```

### 2. Question Indicator on Event (Disabled)
```yaml
Rule: "Show indicator for new question"
Type: event
Source: show_questions (INSERT)
Action: question.indicate → show
Priority: 3 (Normal)
Status: Disabled (you enable when ready)
```

### 3. Excited Mood on Context (Disabled)
```yaml
Rule: "Set excited mood on very positive sentiment"
Type: context
Condition: sentiment = "very_positive", confidence > 0.8
Action: betabot.mood → excited (intensity 8)
Priority: 3 (Normal)
Status: Disabled (AI context detection not implemented yet)
```

---

## 💡 Advanced Features

### Execution Limits
Rules can have `max_executions_per_show`:
```sql
UPDATE trigger_rules
SET max_executions_per_show = 5
WHERE rule_name = 'Show indicator for new question';
```

Now the rule will only trigger 5 times per show. After that, it stops auto-executing until you reset `current_execution_count`.

### Require Operator Approval
Make any rule require manual approval:
```sql
UPDATE trigger_rules
SET require_operator_approval = true
WHERE rule_name = 'Show indicator for new question';
```

Now when the event happens:
1. Decision is created
2. Shows as "pending" in AutomationFeedPanel
3. You click 👍 to approve or 👎 to reject
4. Only executes if approved

### Event Filters
Rules can filter events by column values:

```sql
-- Only trigger for questions asked by specific user
UPDATE trigger_rules
SET trigger_conditions = '{"event_source": "show_questions", "event_type": "insert", "filters": {"asked_by": "VIP"}}'::jsonb
WHERE rule_name = 'Show indicator for new question';
```

Now only questions from "VIP" will trigger the indicator!

### Day/Time Restrictions
Rules can be active only on certain days/times:

```sql
UPDATE trigger_rules
SET
  active_days = ARRAY[1,2,3,4,5], -- Monday-Friday only
  active_time_start = '09:00:00',
  active_time_end = '17:00:00'
WHERE rule_name = 'Show indicator for new question';
```

Now the rule only works on weekdays from 9 AM to 5 PM!

## 📈 Monitoring Event-Based Automation

### Check EventListener Status

In browser console:
```javascript
// EventListener is watching these tables
// Check console logs for:
// "[EventListener] Started listening to X tables"
// "[EventListener] Subscribed to table: show_questions"
```

### Query Automation Events

```sql
-- See all event-triggered automation
SELECT created_at, trigger_type, action_type, outcome
FROM automation_events
WHERE trigger_type = 'event'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- See specific event triggers
SELECT created_at, trigger_data->>'event_source' as source, action_type
FROM automation_events
WHERE trigger_type = 'event'
AND trigger_data->>'event_source' = 'show_questions';

-- Count event triggers per table
SELECT
  trigger_data->>'event_source' as table_name,
  COUNT(*) as trigger_count
FROM automation_events
WHERE trigger_type = 'event'
GROUP BY trigger_data->>'event_source';
```

### Performance Metrics

```sql
-- Average execution time for event triggers
SELECT
  AVG(execution_time_ms) as avg_ms,
  MIN(execution_time_ms) as min_ms,
  MAX(execution_time_ms) as max_ms
FROM automation_events
WHERE trigger_type = 'event'
AND outcome = 'executed';
```

## 🔮 What's Next: Phase 4 - OBS Integration

Now that event-based automation works, Phase 4 will add **OBS camera control**:

### OBS WebSocket Integration
- Install `obs-websocket-js` package
- Connect to OBS (ws://localhost:4455)
- Scene switching
- Source show/hide
- Transitions

### Camera Switching Rules
```yaml
Rule: "Switch to Camera 2 on keyword"
Type: keyword
Keywords: ["camera 2"]
Action: obs.scene → "Camera 2"
```

When you say "camera 2" → OBS switches to Camera 2 scene automatically!

### Example Flow:
```
Host says: "Let's switch to camera 2"
  ↓
Transcript captured
  ↓
TriggerDetector finds "camera 2" keyword
  ↓
Creates decision: obs.scene → "Camera 2"
  ↓
ObsController switches scene
  ↓
Event logged
  ↓
Appears in feed: "Keyword trigger → OBS → Scene → Executed"
```
