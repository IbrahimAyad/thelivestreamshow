## 🎯 Key Improvements

### 1. Clear Active vs Archive
**Active (12 files):**
- Root: 3 files (README, CURRENT_SETUP, CHANGELOG)
- docs/guides/: 4 files
- docs/reference/: 5 files

**Archived (90+ files):**
- All organized by category
- Clear they're historical only

### 2. Single Source of Truth
**Before:** 100+ contradictory docs  
**After:** ONE setup guide ([`CURRENT_SETUP.md`](../CURRENT_SETUP.md))

### 3. Easy Navigation
**Before:** Search through 100 files, hope you find it  
**After:** Check [`docs/INDEX.md`](docs/INDEX.md), find it in 10 seconds

### 4. Logical Structure
**Before:** Random files everywhere  
**After:** 
- guides/ = How to do things
- reference/ = Technical specs
- archive/ = Old stuff
- sessions/ = Development history

---

## 📚 How to Use the New Structure

### Finding Documentation:

1. **Start here:** [`docs/INDEX.md`](docs/INDEX.md)
   - Complete navigation guide
   - "I want to..." quick links
   - What to read when

2. **Visual tree:** [`docs/STRUCTURE.md`](docs/STRUCTURE.md)
   - See the entire structure
   - Understand organization
   - Find by location

3. **Setup guide:** [`CURRENT_SETUP.md`](../CURRENT_SETUP.md)
   - THE authoritative setup guide
   - Updated and accurate
   - Only one to follow

4. **Recent changes:** [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md)
   - See what changed
   - Understand why
   - Migration guides

## ⚠️ Important Rules

### Active Documentation (DO FOLLOW):
- ✅ Root level (3 files)
- ✅ docs/guides/ (how-to guides)
- ✅ docs/reference/ (technical specs)
- ✅ config/system-config.json

### Archive Documentation (DO NOT FOLLOW):
- ❌ docs/archive/* (all categories)
- ❌ These are historical reference only
- ❌ May contain outdated information
- ❌ Not maintained or updated

### When Confused:
1. Ignore everything in `docs/archive/`
2. Read [`CURRENT_SETUP.md`](../CURRENT_SETUP.md)
3. Check [`docs/INDEX.md`](docs/INDEX.md)
4. Run `bash scripts/pre-show-check.sh`
