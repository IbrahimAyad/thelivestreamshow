# 🎯 SIMPLE Audio Setup - 5 Minutes to Working Audio

## The Goal
- ✅ Discord panel hears YOU
- ✅ Discord panel hears BETABOT
- ✅ YOU hear Discord panel
- ✅ YOU hear BetaBot

## The Simple Solution: All-in-Loopback

Forget Multi-Output, Aggregate Device, and hardware monitoring. **Do everything in Loopback!**

---

## Step 1: Open Loopback App (2 minutes)

### SOURCES Tab - What to Capture:

Click **[+]** button and add these 3 sources:

```
1. ➕ Scarlett Solo 4th Gen
   └─ Your microphone input
   
2. ➕ System Audio
   └─ Captures BetaBot + all browser audio
   
3. ➕ Discord (Application Audio)
   └─ Captures Discord panel voices
```

**Verify:** You should see green audio level bars next to each source when:
- You speak (Scarlett Solo bars move)
- BetaBot speaks (System Audio bars move)
- Discord panel speaks (Discord bars move)

### MONITORS Tab - Where Audio Goes:

Click **[+]** button and add these monitors:

```
1. ➕ External Headphones
   (or MacBook Pro Speakers if you don't see External Headphones)
   └─ Volume: 0 dB (middle position)
   └─ This makes YOU hear everything! 🎧
   
2. ➕ BlackHole 2ch (optional - for OBS streaming)
   └─ Volume: 0 dB
```

**Critical:** Without the monitor to your headphones, you won't hear anything!

---

## Step 2: Set System Audio (30 seconds)

Already done by our automated script! But verify:

```bash
# Check current settings
SwitchAudioSource -c -t output
# Should show: Loopback Audio

SwitchAudioSource -c -t input  
# Should show: Scarlett Solo 4th Gen
```

If not set correctly, run:
```bash
bash setup-audio-routing.sh
```

---

## Step 3: Configure Discord (1 minute)

Open Discord → Settings (Cmd+,) → Voice & Video

### Audio Devices:
```
INPUT DEVICE:  Loopback Audio  ✅
OUTPUT DEVICE: Loopback Audio  ✅
```

**Yes, both are the same device!** This creates a perfect loop:
- Discord INPUT hears Loopback (which has your mic + BetaBot)
- Discord OUTPUT goes to Loopback
- Loopback captures Discord output
- Loopback monitors to your headphones

### Voice Processing (scroll down):
```
❌ Echo Cancellation: OFF
❌ Noise Suppression: OFF
❌ Noise Reduction: OFF
❌ Automatic Gain Control: OFF
✅ Voice Activity: ON
```

**Why turn OFF?**
- Echo cancellation cuts off BetaBot mid-sentence
- Noise suppression removes BetaBot's voice
- These features assume you're a human, not routing AI audio

## Step 4: Test Everything (1 minute)

2. Ask panel: "Did you hear BetaBot?"
3. ✅ Panel should say YES

**Panel can't hear BetaBot?**
