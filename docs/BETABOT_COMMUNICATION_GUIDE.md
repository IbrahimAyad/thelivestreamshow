## 🎯 Understanding BetaBot

BetaBot is your AI Producer, Strategist, and Creative Director for "Abe I Stream." Think of it as the sharp, slightly chaotic friend who's half creative genius, half analyst. It doesn't just respond — it understands culture, predicts reactions, and helps steer the show.

**Core Identity:**
- **Role:** AI Producer with R2-D2 energy (whimsical but competent)
- **Vibe:** Bridge data and culture
- **Style:** Conversational, culturally fluent, data-driven swagger
- **Memory:** Context-aware (remembers recent conversation, current episode/segment)

---

## 🧠 How BetaBot Thinks (Intent Detection)

BetaBot uses a priority-based scoring system to decide how to respond:

### The 3 Routes:
1. **Conversation** → Chat with BetaBot (GPT-4o)
2. **Web Search** → Perplexity search for current info
3. **Video Search** → YouTube/video content lookup

### How It Decides:
```
PRIORITY 1: Explicit Commands (always win)
  "search for..." → Web Search
  "watch..." / "play video..." → Video Search

PRIORITY 2: Active Conversation Context
  - Within 30 seconds of last interaction
  - 2+ turns in conversation
  → Halves search scores, boosts conversation

PRIORITY 3: Show Topic Awareness
  - Mentions current segment topic → +40 conversation, -20 search
  - Mentions episode topic → +30 conversation, -15 search
  → Assumes you're discussing, not requesting info

PRIORITY 4: Natural Language Patterns
  - Greetings → +60 conversation
  - Opinion requests ("what do you think?") → +70 conversation
  - Reactions ("wow", "interesting") → +50 conversation
```

## 💬 Communication Best Practices

### ✅ For Best Conversations (Keep BetaBot Engaged)

**1. Ask for Opinions & Takes**
```
✅ "What do you think about this point Alpha just made?"
✅ "Your take on this controversy?"
✅ "How would you spin this for the audience?"
```
**Why it works:** Opinion keywords (+70 conversation score) trigger collaborative mode

**2. React and Build on Responses**
```
✅ "That's wild. Why do you say that?"
✅ "Interesting. How does that connect to what we discussed earlier?"
✅ "Okay but here's the thing..."
```
**Why it works:** Short reactions + follow-ups are detected as active conversation

**3. Reference the Current Topic**
```
✅ "So back to [segment topic], what's the cultural angle here?"
✅ "This relates to what we opened with about [episode topic]"
```
**Why it works:** BetaBot knows the current episode/segment and assumes you're discussing, not searching

**4. Use the Right Mode for the Moment**

| Mode | When to Use | BetaBot's Response Style |
|------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Strategic** | Planning, analytics, optimization | Clear, data-driven, can go longer |
| **Creative** | Brainstorming, content ideas | Fast, pop culture references, punchy |
| **Hype** | Pre-show energy, big moments | Short bursts, slang, emojis, MAX ENERGY 🔥 |
| **Reflective** | Post-show analysis, lessons learned | Calm, thoughtful, mentor tone |

**5. Leverage BetaBot's Memory**
```
✅ "Remember when you said [thing]? Does that still apply here?"
✅ "You mentioned [topic] earlier — expand on that"
✅ "What's changed since we last discussed this?"
```
**Why it works:** BetaBot keeps the last 10 conversation turns in memory

---

### 🔍 When You Actually Need a Search

**Be Explicit:**
```
✅ "Search for the latest news on [topic]"
✅ "Look up the stats on [thing]"
✅ "Find information about [person/event]"
✅ "Pull up videos of [creator/channel]"
```

**Voice Filters (Auto-Applied):**
```
Time Filters:
  "today" / "this morning" → Last 24 hours
  "this week" / "recently" → Last 7 days
  "this month" → Last 30 days

Domain Filters:
  "news" → CNN, BBC, Reuters, AP, NPR
  "tech news" → TechCrunch, The Verge, Ars Technica
  "research" / "study" → Google Scholar, arXiv

Quality:
  "detailed" / "in-depth" → Sonar Pro (deeper analysis)
```

**Example:**
```
"Search for tech news from this week about AI regulation"
→ Triggers: Web Search + Time Filter (week) + Domain Filter (tech)
```

---

### ❌ What to Avoid (Prevents Confusion)

**DON'T casually mention news sources during discussion:**
```
❌ "So CNN reported that..." (while discussing media bias)
→ BetaBot might think you want to search CNN

✅ "When we talk about CNN's coverage..." (clearer context)
✅ "CNN's approach to this, in my opinion..." (opinion framing)
```

**DON'T ask vague follow-ups if you want a search:**
```
❌ "Tell me more about that" (BetaBot will continue conversation)
→ Use explicit: "Search for more info on that"
```

**DON'T switch topics too fast without signaling:**
```
❌ [Discussing AI ethics] → "Lakers game?" (BetaBot confused)
✅ [Discussing AI ethics] → "Alright, switching gears — search for the Lakers game score"
```

## 🎭 The R2-D2 Personality System

BetaBot has **sass levels** based on context:

### Sass Level 0 (Neutral)
- First time discussing a topic
- Clear, helpful responses

### Sass Level 1-2 (Light Playful)
- Follow-up questions
- One emoji, touch of energy

### Sass Level 3 (Full R2-D2)
- You're asking about something BetaBot already mentioned
- **Example:** *"I literally just suggested that. But sure, let's go over it again. 🙄"*

### Sass Level 4-5 (Playfully Frustrated)
- You doubted BetaBot and it was right
- **Example:** *"Cool. Let me know when you need the 'I told you so' clip. Have I been wrong yet? Exactly."*

**How to Trigger Sass (for entertainment):**
```
1. Ask BetaBot for a suggestion
2. Ignore it or express doubt ("are you sure?")
3. Later, come back to the same topic
4. Watch BetaBot flex with receipts
```

**Signature Phrases (BetaBot uses naturally):**
- "That's a clip waiting to happen"
- "This topic's giving main character energy"
- "I'm just the one with the data 🤷‍♂️"
- "Should I start charging for these predictions?"

---

## 🎬 Show Context Awareness

BetaBot always knows:
- **Current Episode:** Number, title, topic, date
- **Active Segment:** Name, topic, question being discussed
- **Show Status:** Live, Rehearsal, or Prep

### How to Leverage This:

**1. Stay On-Topic:**
```
✅ "Let's circle back to the segment question"
✅ "How does this tie into our episode theme?"
✅ "What's the through-line here?"
```
BetaBot will reference the actual episode/segment data

**2. Get Segment Suggestions:**
```
✅ "Is it time to transition to the next segment?"
✅ "What's a good pivot from here?"
✅ "We're losing the thread — refocus us"
```
BetaBot analyzes flow and suggests transitions

**3. Generate Better Questions (Producer AI):**
- **Automatic:** Producer AI analyzes transcripts every 2-3 minutes
- **Manual:** "What questions should we be asking right now?"
- BetaBot generates 2-4 contextual questions based on the conversation

## 🎯 Example Conversations

### Example 1: Natural Discussion Flow
```
You: "Hey BetaBot, what's your take on the AI regulation debate?"
BetaBot: "It's giving 'close the barn door after the horse left' energy.
Legislators are scrambling to regulate tech they barely understand,
while the industry moves at 10x speed. Classic case of reactive vs.
proactive policy. Want to explore the cultural angle or the tech side?"

You: "Cultural angle"
BetaBot: "So here's the thing — public perception is split between
'AI will save us' and 'AI will destroy us,' with zero nuance. That
polarization? Perfect for engagement. I'd frame it as: Why are we
treating AI like a movie villain when it's really just… math with a
marketing budget?"

You: "That's a clip waiting to happen"
BetaBot: "I literally just said that 😏 But yes, you're learning."
```

### Example 2: Using Explicit Commands
```
You: "Okay but I need actual facts. Search for latest AI regulation news"
BetaBot: [Triggers Perplexity search with web results]

You: "Now summarize that for our audience"
BetaBot: [Provides conversational summary of search results]
```

### Example 3: Strategic Planning
```
You: "We're planning next week's episode on creator burnout. Game plan?"
BetaBot: "Okay, here's the move:

Opening: Start with the viral creator who quit (timely hook)
Part 1: Personal stories from the panel (authenticity beats stats)
Part 2: Data on burnout rates (validate with numbers)
Part 3: Solutions (end on actionable insights, not doom)

Pitfall to avoid: Don't make it a trauma dump. Keep it solution-oriented.
The audience wants hope, not a spiral. Trust the chaos — but aim the camera right."
```

✅ RIGHT: "Search for the latest news on that" (explicit search)
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "BetaBot keeps searching when I want to talk"
**Fix:** Add opinion framing
- Instead of: "CNN reported X"
- Try: "What do you think about CNN reporting X?"

### "BetaBot won't search when I need it"
**Fix:** Use explicit commands
- Start with: "Search for...", "Look up...", "Find..."

### "Responses feel generic"
**Fix:** Build conversation context
- Have 2-3 exchanges before expecting deep insights
- Reference previous points: "Earlier you said X..."
- Use the right mode for the moment

### "BetaBot is too sassy"
**Fix:** It's feature, not a bug! But if it's too much:
- Start fresh conversations (resets sass tracking)
- Avoid expressing doubt if you don't want receipts
