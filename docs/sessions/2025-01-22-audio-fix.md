# Session Notes: Audio Routing Fix & Stability Framework
**Date:** 2025-01-22  
**Duration:** ~6 hours  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Version:** 4.0.0

---

## üéØ Session Goals

1. Fix audio playback stopping after 1 second
2. Configure Discord + BetaBot bidirectional audio
3. Establish stability framework to prevent future rework

---

## üî¥ Problems Encountered

### 1. Audio Playback Issue (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** BetaBot TTS audio played for < 1 second then stopped  
**Root Cause:** Browser Audio element cannot route to virtual audio devices (Loopback/BlackHole)  
**Impact:** Show-stopping - BetaBot couldn't speak

### 2. Audio Routing Confusion
**Problem:** Multiple conflicting approaches (Multi-Output vs Aggregate vs Loopback)  
**Root Cause:** Too many documentation files with different solutions  
**Impact:** Wasted 2+ hours trying different configurations

### 3. Configuration Loss
**Problem:** Working audio setup from previous session was lost  
**Root Cause:** No configuration tracking, manual setup each time  
**Impact:** Had to re-solve same problems

### 4. Headphone Connection Issue
**Problem:** User's headphones connected to Mac instead of Scarlett Solo  
**Root Cause:** Standard 3.5mm jack, no adapter for Scarlett's 1/4" jack  
**Impact:** Couldn't hear audio even when routing was correct

### 5. Documentation Overload
**Problem:** 100+ markdown files, impossible to find current truth  
**Root Cause:** No cleanup strategy, documents accumulated over time  
**Impact:** Confusion, contradictory information

---

## ‚úÖ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Backend Audio Playback (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Solution:** Play TTS audio through backend server instead of browser

**Implementation:**
- Added `/api/betabot/play-audio` endpoint in `backend/server.js`
- Backend saves audio blob to temp file
- Uses `afplay` command to play through system output (Loopback)
- Cleans up temp file after playback

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// backend/server.js
this.app.post('/api/betabot/play-audio', async (req, res) => {
  const audioBuffer = Buffer.concat(chunks);
  await fs.promises.writeFile(tempFile, audioBuffer);
  await execPromise(`afplay "${tempFile}"`);
  this.broadcast({ type: 'betabot_audio_complete' });
  await fs.promises.unlink(tempFile);
});
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Audio plays completely through correct routing

### 2. WebSocket Notification System (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Solution:** Backend notifies frontend when audio playback completes

**Implementation:**
- Backend broadcasts `betabot_audio_complete` event via WebSocket
- Frontend listens for event and updates `isSpeaking` state
- Removed inaccurate duration estimation

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// src/hooks/useF5TTS.ts
useEffect(() => {
  const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:3001');
  ws.onmessage = (event) => {
    if (data.type === 'betabot_audio_complete') {
      setIsSpeaking(false);
      onStateChangeRef.current?.('idle');
    }
  };
}, []);
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Accurate state tracking, UI shows correct status

### 3. Simplified Audio Configuration (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Solution:** Loopback-only approach, eliminate confusion

**Decision:** 
- ‚ùå NO Multi-Output Device (output-only, can't be Discord input)
- ‚ùå NO Aggregate Device (unnecessary complexity)
- ‚ùå NO Hardware Monitoring (requires specific cables)
- ‚úÖ YES Loopback for everything (simple, works with standard headphones)

**Configuration:**
```
Loopback Sources:
  1. Scarlett Solo 4th Gen (microphone)
  2. System Audio (BetaBot TTS)
  3. Discord (panel voices)

Loopback Monitors:
  1. External Headphones (user hears all)
  2. BlackHole 2ch (OBS captures)

Discord Settings:
  Input: Loopback Audio
  Output: Loopback Audio
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ One clear path, works with any headphones

### 4. Stability Infrastructure (CRITICAL)
**Solution:** Prevent future rework with 5-Pillar framework

**Implemented:**

#### Pillar 1: Single Source of Truth
- Created `config/system-config.json` - Master configuration file
- Created `CURRENT_SETUP.md` - ONE setup guide (archived 100+ old docs)
- Created `CHANGELOG.md` - Track all changes going forward

#### Pillar 2: Configuration as Code  
- Created `scripts/setup-audio-routing.sh` - Automated audio setup
- Created `scripts/test-audio-routing.sh` - Automated testing
- Created `config/snapshots/` - State backup location

#### Pillar 3: Automated Testing
- Created `scripts/pre-show-check.sh` - Comprehensive health check
- Checks: Services, audio routing, configuration files, BetaBot voices
- Exit codes: 0 = ready, 1 = issues found

#### Pillar 4: Health Monitoring
- Created `src/components/AudioHealthCheck.tsx` - Visual dashboard
- Shows: Backend, Piper TTS, Audio Output, Scarlett status
- Auto-refreshes every 5 seconds
- Provides troubleshooting tips

#### Pillar 5: Documentation Strategy
- Active docs: 5 files (vs 100+)
- Archived: `docs/archive/` (reference only)
- Session notes: `docs/sessions/` (this file)

**Result:** ‚úÖ Foundation for long-term stability

## üéì Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well:
1. ‚úÖ Backend audio playback - Reliable, simple, works
2. ‚úÖ WebSocket notifications - Accurate state tracking
3. ‚úÖ Loopback-only approach - Simpler than multi-device setups
4. ‚úÖ Pre-show check script - Instant problem detection
5. ‚úÖ Configuration as code - Reproducible setup

### What Didn't Work:
1. ‚ùå Browser Audio element - Can't route to virtual devices
2. ‚ùå Multi-Output Device as input - It's output-only!
3. ‚ùå Aggregate Device - Unnecessary complexity
4. ‚ùå Duration estimation - Inaccurate, replaced with WebSocket
5. ‚ùå 100+ doc files - Information overload

### Decisions Made:
1. **Backend audio playback** - More reliable than browser
2. **Loopback-only approach** - Simpler than alternatives
3. **Configuration in git** - system-config.json tracked
4. **Documentation consolidation** - 5 files max, rest archived
5. **Automated health checks** - Pre-show script is mandatory

## üí° Key Insights

### Root Cause of Today's Rework:
1. **No configuration tracking** - Lost working setup
2. **Documentation chaos** - 100+ files, conflicting info
3. **No automated verification** - Manual testing took too long
4. **Context loss** - AI forgot previous solutions

### Prevention Strategy:
1. **Single source of truth** - config/system-config.json
2. **One setup guide** - CURRENT_SETUP.md only
3. **Automated checks** - pre-show-check.sh mandatory
4. **Session notes** - Document everything (this file!)
5. **Git-tracked config** - Never lose working state

### Success Criteria Met:
- ‚úÖ Audio plays completely
- ‚úÖ State tracking accurate
- ‚úÖ Simple configuration
- ‚úÖ Automated verification
- ‚úÖ Documented everything
