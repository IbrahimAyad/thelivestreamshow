# 🔧 LOOPBACK QUICK FIX - You Can't Hear Audio

## The Problem
You changed Discord input to Loopback ✅ (correct!)
But Discord output is still Loopback ❌ (wrong!)
This creates a loop and you can't hear anything.

## The Solution

### 1. Loopback App Configuration (Open Now!)

#### SOURCES Tab - What Loopback Captures:
```
[+] Add These Sources:

1. Scarlett Solo 4th Gen
   └─ This captures YOUR MICROPHONE
   
2. System Audio (or Safari/Chrome/Firefox)
   └─ This captures BETABOT from browser
   
3. Discord (optional)
   └─ This captures Discord panel voices
```

#### MONITORS Tab - Where Audio Goes:
```
[+] Add These Monitors:

1. Scarlett Solo 4th Gen
   └─ Volume: 0 dB
   └─ Sends to YOUR HEADPHONES ✅
   
2. BlackHole 2ch (optional)
   └─ Volume: 0 dB  
   └─ Sends to OBS for streaming
```

### 2. Discord Settings - CHANGE OUTPUT!

**Voice & Video Settings:**
```
INPUT DEVICE:  Loopback Audio          ✅ Keep this!
OUTPUT DEVICE: Scarlett Solo 4th Gen   ← CHANGE TO THIS!
```

**Voice Processing:**
```
❌ Echo Cancellation: OFF
❌ Noise Suppression: OFF
❌ Noise Reduction: OFF
❌ Automatic Gain Control: OFF
✅ Voice Activity: ON
```

### 3. Scarlett Solo Hardware
```
MONITOR MIX knob: Can be anywhere (doesn't matter now)
Just make sure headphones are plugged into HEADPHONES jack
```

## ✅ After Configuration

**You should hear:**
- ✅ Your own voice (through Loopback monitor)
- ✅ BetaBot speaking (through Loopback monitor)
- ✅ Discord panel members (through Discord output → Scarlett)

**Discord panel should hear:**
- ✅ Your microphone (Loopback capturing Scarlett)
- ✅ BetaBot browser audio (Loopback capturing System Audio)

---

## 🧪 Quick Test

1. **Speak into mic**
   - You hear yourself? ✅
   - Discord panel hears you? ✅

2. **Click "Test TTS" in dashboard**
   - You hear BetaBot? ✅
   - Discord panel hears BetaBot? ✅

3. **Ask Discord panel member to speak**
   - You hear them? ✅

All 3 work? You're done! 🚀
