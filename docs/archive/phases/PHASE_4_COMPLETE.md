# 🎥 Auto-Director Phase 4 - COMPLETE!

## ✅ What We Built

Phase 4 adds **OBS Camera Control** - The system can now automatically switch OBS scenes and control sources!

### New Core Service
- ✅ **ObsController** (`/src/lib/obs/ObsController.ts`)
  - Connects to OBS Studio via WebSocket (ws://localhost:4455)
  - Auto-reconnect on disconnect (up to 5 attempts)
  - Scene switching with transitions
  - Source visibility control
  - Stream/recording control
  - Scene list retrieval
  - Connection status monitoring

### New UI Component
- ✅ **OBSConnectionPanel** (`/src/components/OBSConnectionPanel.tsx`)
  - Connection form with URL and password
  - Connection status indicator (Connected/Disconnected)
  - Current scene display
  - Available scenes list with one-click switching
  - Refresh scenes button
  - Disconnect button
  - Error messaging
  - Help text for OBS setup

### Integration Updates
- ✅ **ActionExecutor** updated to use ObsController
- ✅ **AutomationEngine** has setObsController() method
- ✅ **useAutomationEngine** creates ObsController and injects it
- ✅ **App.tsx** includes OBSConnectionPanel in AI Auto-Director section

## 🎮 How It Works

### The OBS Automation Flow

```
1. User clicks "Connect to OBS" in dashboard
   ↓
2. ObsController connects via WebSocket
   ↓
3. Retrieves scene list and current scene
   ↓
4. ObsController injected into AutomationEngine
   ↓
5. Automation triggers detected (keyword, event, manual, etc.)
   ↓
6. TriggerDetector creates decision with obs.scene action
   ↓
7. ActionExecutor calls obsController.switchScene()
   ↓
8. OBS switches to new scene
   ↓
9. Event logged to automation_events
   ↓
10. Appears in AutomationFeedPanel
```

### Example: Keyword Trigger for Camera Switch

**Database Rule:**
```sql
INSERT INTO trigger_rules (
  rule_name,
  description,
  enabled,
  priority,
  trigger_type,
  trigger_conditions,
  action_type,
  action_params
) VALUES (
  'Switch to Camera 2 on keyword',
  'Auto-switch to Camera 2 when host says "camera 2"',
  true,
  2,
  'keyword',
  '{"keywords": ["camera 2", "switch to 2", "cam 2"]}'::jsonb,
  'obs.scene',
  '{"sceneName": "Camera 2", "transition": "Fade", "transitionDuration": 300}'::jsonb
);
```

**What Happens:**
1. Host says "camera 2" on stream
2. Transcript captured (in future Phase)
3. TriggerDetector finds keyword match
4. Creates decision: obs.scene → "Camera 2"
5. ActionExecutor calls obsController.switchScene("Camera 2", "Fade", 300)
6. OBS switches to Camera 2 scene with 300ms fade
7. Event logged: keyword trigger → OBS scene → executed
8. Appears in feed with details

**All automatic. No button clicking. Just talk, and the camera switches!**

## 🧪 How to Test OBS Camera Control

### Prerequisites

1. **Install OBS Studio** (if not already installed)
   - Download from https://obsproject.com/
   - Version 28+ required (has built-in WebSocket server)

2. **Enable WebSocket Server in OBS**
   - Open OBS Studio
   - Go to: **Tools → WebSocket Server Settings**
   - Check "Enable WebSocket server"
   - Default port: 4455
   - Optional: Set password (not required for local testing)
   - Click "Apply" and "OK"

3. **Create Test Scenes in OBS**
   - Create at least 2 scenes:
     - "Camera 1" (or "Main Camera")
     - "Camera 2" (or "Wide Shot")
   - Add sources to each scene (video capture device, images, etc.)

### Test 1: Manual Connection

**Setup:**
1. Make sure OBS is running
2. Enable WebSocket server (see above)
3. Open dashboard (http://localhost:5173)
4. Scroll to "AI Auto-Director System" section
5. Find "OBS Camera Control" panel

**Test:**
1. Enter WebSocket URL: `ws://localhost:4455`

- Auto-switch when segment changes
- Auto-switch when question received
- Auto-switch based on database events

✅ **Source Visibility Control**
- Show/hide overlays in OBS
- Toggle graphics, logos, banners
- Automated lower thirds in OBS

✅ **Stream/Recording Control**
- Start/stop streaming programmatically

## 🔮 Integration with Other Phases

### Phase 1-3 Integration (Already Working!)

**Event-Based OBS Control:**
```sql
-- Auto-switch to Question scene when question added
INSERT INTO trigger_rules (
  rule_name,
  enabled,
  priority,
  trigger_type,
  trigger_conditions,
  action_type,
  action_params
) VALUES (
  'Switch to Q&A scene on new question',
  true,
  2,
  'event',
  '{"event_source": "show_questions", "event_type": "insert"}'::jsonb,
  'obs.scene',
  '{"sceneName": "Q&A Scene"}'::jsonb
);
```

Now when a question is added to the database, OBS automatically switches to your Q&A scene!

**Segment-Based Switching:**
```sql
-- Switch scenes based on show segment
INSERT INTO trigger_rules (
  rule_name,
  enabled,
  priority,
  trigger_type,
  trigger_conditions,
  action_type,
  action_params
) VALUES (
  'Switch to Intro scene on intro segment',
  true,
  2,
  'event',
  '{"event_source": "show_segments", "event_type": "update", "filters": {"segment_name": "Intro"}}'::jsonb,
  'obs.scene',
  '{"sceneName": "Intro Scene", "transition": "Stinger"}'::jsonb
);
```

### Phase 5+ Integration (Future)

**Phase 5: Keyword Detection**
- "camera 2" → switches to Camera 2
- "let's see the demo" → switches to Demo scene
- "back to me" → switches to Main Camera

**Phase 6: AI Intent Detection**
- AI detects discussion topic → suggests relevant scene
- AI detects Q&A starting → suggests Q&A scene
- AI detects demo → suggests Screen Share scene

**Phase 7: Auto-Execution**
- High-confidence scene switches execute automatically
- Low-confidence switches wait for approval
- Safety limits prevent rapid scene changes

## 💡 Advanced OBS Features

### Transition Control

Specify transition type and duration:
```javascript
await obsController.switchScene('Camera 2', 'Fade', 300)  // 300ms fade
await obsController.switchScene('Wide Shot', 'Cut', 0)     // Instant cut
await obsController.switchScene('Demo', 'Stinger')          // Stinger transition
```

Available transitions depend on your OBS setup.

### Source Visibility

Show/hide specific sources:
```javascript
// Show a logo overlay
await obsController.toggleSource('Logo', true, 'Main Camera')

// Hide lower third
await obsController.toggleSource('Lower Third', false)
```

### Scene Items

Get all sources in a scene:
```javascript
const items = await obsController.getSceneItems('Main Camera')
// Returns array of scene items with properties
```

### Streaming Control

Control streaming programmatically:
```javascript
// Start streaming
await obsController.startStreaming()

// Check if streaming
const isStreaming = await obsController.getStreamingStatus()

// Stop streaming
await obsController.stopStreaming()
```

---

## 📈 Monitoring OBS Automation

### Check ObsController Status

In browser console:
```javascript
// ObsController logs
// "[OBS] Connecting to ws://localhost:4455"
// "[OBS] Connected successfully: OBS 30.0.0 / WebSocket 5.0.0"
// "[OBS] Switched to scene: Camera 2"
```

### Query OBS Automation Events

```sql
-- See all OBS-triggered automation
SELECT created_at, trigger_type, action_type, outcome, action_data
FROM automation_events
WHERE action_type LIKE 'obs.%'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Count scene switches
SELECT
  action_data->>'sceneName' as scene_name,
  COUNT(*) as switch_count
FROM automation_events
WHERE action_type = 'obs.scene'
AND outcome = 'executed'
GROUP BY action_data->>'sceneName'
ORDER BY switch_count DESC;

-- Average execution time for OBS actions
SELECT
  action_type,
  AVG(execution_time_ms) as avg_ms,
  COUNT(*) as execution_count
FROM automation_events
WHERE action_type LIKE 'obs.%'
AND outcome = 'executed'
GROUP BY action_type;
```
