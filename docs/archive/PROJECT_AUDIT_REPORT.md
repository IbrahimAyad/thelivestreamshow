## 1. Project Scope & Architecture

### 1.1 Project Overview

**Purpose**: A comprehensive live stream production dashboard for managing broadcast overlays, AI co-host (BetaBot), automated director system, and multi-show management.

**Target Use Case**: Live streaming production environment where a single operator needs to control:
- Graphics overlays (Starting Soon, BRB, Tech Issues, OUTRO, etc.)
- AI co-host personality and movements
- OBS camera switching and scene management
- Question queue and segment timing
- Automated triggers based on conversation context

### 1.2 Technology Stack

#### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18.3 + TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **UI Library**: Radix UI primitives + shadcn/ui components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React hooks + Supabase real-time subscriptions
- **Icons**: Lucide React

#### Backend & Services
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with real-time capabilities)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage
- **TTS Engine**: F5-TTS (Piper voices) running locally in Docker
- **OBS Integration**: obs-websocket-js v5
- **AI Services**: OpenAI GPT-4, Perplexity API, Reddit API, YouTube API

#### Infrastructure
- **Containerization**: Docker Compose for F5-TTS server
- **Development Server**: Vite dev server (port 5173)
- **Deployment**: Ready for static hosting (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)

### 1.3 Architecture Patterns

**✅ Strengths:**
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between UI components, business logic (lib/), and hooks
2. **Service Layer Pattern**: ShowManager, AutomationEngine, OBS Controller as singleton services
3. **Real-time Sync**: Supabase subscriptions for live data updates across all components
4. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Automation system uses event bus pattern
5. **Component Composition**: Radix UI primitives composed into higher-level components

**⚠️ Areas for Improvement:**
1. **State Management**: No centralized state management (Zustand/Redux) - relies on props drilling and subscriptions
2. **Error Boundaries**: Limited error boundary implementation
3. **Code Splitting**: No lazy loading or route-based code splitting
4. **Type Safety**: Some `any` types found in automation engine

**Recommendation**: Break down into smaller, focused components
**Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

#### ⚠️ No State Management Library
- Relies on prop drilling and subscriptions
- No centralized application state
- Complex components manage local state

**Impact**: MEDIUM
**Risk**: State synchronization issues, prop drilling complexity
**Recommendation**: Consider Zustand or Jotai for global state
**Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

## 7. Critical Issues & Risks

### High Priority Issues

#### 1. Zero Test Coverage ⚠️⚠️⚠️
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Impact**: No automated testing means:
- High risk of regressions
- Manual testing required for all changes
- Difficult to refactor with confidence
- Production bugs likely

**Recommendation**:
```bash
# Add testing framework
pnpm add -D vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
pnpm add -D @playwright/test

# Create test structure
mkdir -p src/__tests__/components
mkdir -p src/__tests__/lib
mkdir -p e2e

# Write tests for:
1. AutomationEngine.ts (unit tests)
2. ShowManager.ts (unit tests)
3. Critical UI workflows (E2E tests)
```

**Effort**: 2-3 weeks for comprehensive coverage

#### 2. Large Component Files ⚠️
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: Difficult maintenance, slow code review

**Recommendation**: Refactor BetaBotControlPanel.tsx into smaller components:
- Extract mood control to `BetaBotMoodControl.tsx`
- Extract movement control to `BetaBotMovementControl.tsx`
- Extract conversation panel to `BetaBotConversationPanel.tsx`
- Keep main panel as orchestrator

**Effort**: 1-2 days

#### 3. No Global State Management ⚠️
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: Prop drilling, potential state sync issues

**Recommendation**:
```bash
# Add Zustand for simple global state
pnpm add zustand

# Create stores for:
- Active show state
- BetaBot state
- Automation engine state
- OBS connection state
```

**Effort**: 3-5 days

### Medium Priority Issues

#### 4. Missing Error Boundaries ⚠️
**Recommendation**: Wrap major sections with error boundaries:
```tsx
<ErrorBoundary fallback={<ErrorFallback />}>
  <BetaBotControlPanel />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

**Effort**: 1 day

#### 5. No Code Splitting ⚠️
**Recommendation**:
```tsx
const ShowManagerPanel = lazy(() => import('./components/ShowManagerPanel'))
const PresetManagerPanel = lazy(() => import('./components/PresetManagerPanel'))
```

**Effort**: 1 day

### Low Priority Issues

#### 6. Backup Files in src/ ⚠️
**Recommendation**: Move to `/backups` directory or delete

**Effort**: 5 minutes
