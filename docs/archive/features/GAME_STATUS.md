## ⏳ PENDING: SAVE THE IMAGE

**The game is 95% ready!** Only one thing left:

### 📸 Save Netanyahu Image

**Where to find it:**
- Scroll up in this chat conversation
- Look for the Netanyahu image you shared earlier

**How to save it:**
1. Right-click the image in the chat
2. Click "Save As..." or "Save Image As..."
3. Navigate to: `/Users/ibrahim/Desktop/thelivestreamshow/public/targets/`
4. Name it exactly: `netanyahu.jpg`
5. Click Save

**Important:**
- Must be named exactly `netanyahu.jpg` (no extra extensions)
- Must be saved in `/public/targets/` folder
- The game HTML is already configured to load from `/targets/netanyahu.jpg`

---

## 🧪 TESTING STEPS

Once the image is saved:

### 1. Check Database
Go to Supabase SQL Editor and run:
```sql
SELECT * FROM broadcast_graphics WHERE graphic_type = 'brb_tomato_game';
```
Should show one row with `html_file = '/brb-tomato-game.html'`

If nothing appears, run the migration:
```sql
-- Copy contents from /supabase/migrations/add_brb_tomato_game.sql
```

### 2. Test in Browser
1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Find "Graphics Overlays" section
3. Click "BRB Tomato Game" button
4. Should turn ACTIVE with cyan glow
5. Check Broadcast Preview - game should appear fullscreen

### 3. Play the Game
- **Click anywhere** on the preview to throw tomatoes
- **Spacebar** for random throw on target
- **R** to reset game
- Watch health bar decrease from 100% to 0%
- See K.O. animation when defeated

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Game button doesn't appear
**Fix:** Run database migration in Supabase

### Game appears but no image
**Fix:** Save Netanyahu image to `/public/targets/netanyahu.jpg`

### Image appears but is broken/wrong
**Check:**
- File is named exactly `netanyahu.jpg`
- No double extensions (not `netanyahu.jpg.jpg`)
- File is in `/public/targets/` folder
- Browser console for 404 errors

### Tomatoes don't throw
**Fix:**
- Click directly on the Broadcast Preview iframe
- The game needs focus to receive clicks
