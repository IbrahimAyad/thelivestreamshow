## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Integrate into Dashboard

Choose one:

**Option A: Standalone panel (recommended for first stream)**
```tsx
// Add after EmergencyControlsPanel in StudioControlPanel.tsx
<ShowIntroController dualDeck={dualDeck} className="max-w-4xl mx-auto" />
```

**Option B: In Tools tab**
```tsx
// Add inside activeDJTab === 'tools'
<CollapsibleSection title="Show Intro Automation" icon={<Monitor />}>
  <ShowIntroController dualDeck={dualDeck} />
</CollapsibleSection>
```

### Step 2: Load Songs

1. Load **Song 1** on **Deck A**
2. Load **Song 2** on **Deck B**

### Step 3: Start Sequence

Click **"Start Intro Sequence"** button

The system will:
- ✅ Play Song 1 automatically
- ✅ Crossfade to Song 2 at 3:30
- ✅ Pause at 1:19.5 and show game
- ✅ Wait for boss defeat (no timer)
- ✅ Resume and finish automatically

---

## ⚙️ Technical Architecture

### Event-Driven State Machine

```typescript
States:
idle → song1_playing → crossfading → song2_playing 
  → game_active → resuming → song2_finishing → complete
```

### Auto-Progression Triggers

1. **Time-based**: Monitors deck playback positions (100ms intervals)
2. **Event-based**: Listens for `BOSS_DEFEATED` postMessage
3. **Position-based**: Detects when song reaches specific timestamps

### Graphics Integration

Automatically manages Supabase graphics:
- Shows/hides tomato game
- Shows/hides DJ visualizer
- Smooth transitions via database updates

---

## 🎮 Game Integration

### Boss Defeat Event

```javascript
// In brb-tomato-game.html
window.parent.postMessage({ type: 'BOSS_DEFEATED' }, '*');
```

### Event Listener

```typescript
// In useShowIntroSequence.ts
window.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
  if (event.data.type === 'BOSS_DEFEATED') {
    handleBossDefeated(); // Auto-resume sequence
  }
});
```

### No Timer Pressure

- Game runs indefinitely
- No countdown shown to players
- Natural gameplay experience
- Sequence waits patiently at "game_active" step

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Sequence Won't Start
- **Check**: Are both decks loaded?
- **Fix**: Load tracks before starting

### Game Doesn't Show
- **Check**: Is `brb_tomato_game` in database?
- **Fix**: Run graphics migration

### Boss Defeat Not Detected
- **Check**: Console for postMessage errors
- **Fix**: Ensure same origin (both on localhost:5173)

### Crossfade Not Smooth
- **Check**: Crossfader curve setting
- **Fix**: Use 'smooth' curve in dual deck mixer
