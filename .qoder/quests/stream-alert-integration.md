# Stream Alert Integration - Claude Production Alert

## Overview

This feature integrates a Claude-themed terminal animation overlay into the live stream automation system. When the keyword "production" is spoken during the stream, a transparent overlay displays a Claude terminal animation showing a mock system update/fix sequence. This provides visual feedback to viewers when production issues are noted (or for dramatic effect), reinforcing the AI-assisted production narrative.

### Purpose

- **Automated Visual Feedback**: Instantly display production alert animation when "production" keyword is detected
- **Viewer Engagement**: Create entertaining visual moments during technical acknowledgments
- **AI System Reinforcement**: Visually demonstrate the AI production system "working" to fix issues
- **Seamless Integration**: Leverage existing speech recognition and automation infrastructure

### Repository Type

Full-Stack Application (React frontend + Node.js backend + Supabase database)

## Architecture

### System Integration Points

The feature integrates with the existing **Producer AI** system, which continuously listens to stream audio and generates transcripts for BetaBot. We leverage this transcript stream to detect the "production" keyword and trigger the alert overlay.
